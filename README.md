## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Do you and your friends like music but you all want to play your own songs? Our application Vibe Check will allow you and your friends to share and listen to music together with a real-time global jukebox where users vote on the next song to be played in a public digital space. It’s a live democracy for background music. Users can serach for songs to add to the digital que, and users can upvote and downvote songs to be played next. It keeps things fair and concise.

### Key features

- Login and account system
- Ability to search up songs using Youtube API
- Ability to upvove and downvote songs
- Ability to chat with others online

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for the actual jukebox. 
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Highly reactive UI that will animate song cards as they shuffle positions in the queue based on WebSocket data, as well as the react-youtube library will allow songs to be searched and played. 
- **Service** - Backend server will act as a middleman between your React app and Google’s servers, and contains endpoints for login, songs, upvotes, and downvotes. 
- **DB/Login** - Store users, songs, and votes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't use jukebox unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user as adds songs or upvotes/downvotes a song, it is displayed to all users.
